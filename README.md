## Charter vs District performance. 

   I think there is a compelling argument that Charter schools provide a higher academic level of education that district schools. Not only are the top five overall performing schools Chartered, whilst the lowest five are District. When comparing the two types, we can note a four-point difference in Maths scores on average, paired with a 27% difference in overall passing rates. 

   This is significant because maths, unlike typical English assessments, will only have one correct answer. Either a student knows the answer, or they do not. They've either been taught the answer, or they haven't. Meanwhile, there is a degree of subjectivity to English, as well as exposure to the language in everyday life for students living in America. So, the dependence on the quality of education for Maths results is much higher than English. This is not only why we can assert that Chartered schools provide high quality of Maths education, but a higher quality of education overall. 
 
## Smaller and more tightly budgeted schools perform better. 
   The overall passing percentage of a school with a budget of less than $585 (90.37%) is 68% larger than schools with larger funding per students, $645-680 at 53.53%. This massive disparity is surprising, you would expect a school with more funding for its students to perform better than one with less. But we could attribute a few reasons for why this may be. 

   Potentially, a school with more funding for its students has a large, bloated infrastructure and for several decades, funds have been mismanaged and created many unnecessary expenditures. This could be into programs or initiatives which distract from academic success, such as sports facilities, or subjects which are not English or Maths, our only two metrics for deeming success. 

   It could also indicate a difference in priorities from the schools. A school with a lower per student budget may have the sole focus profit. The way in which their school is profitable is through encouraging parents to pay for their child's education. A parent would only be willing to do this if the education the student was receiving was high quality, so, due to their profit-orientated goal, the school uses the minimum budget required to provide a great standard of teaching. As well, a school's budget does not mean that 100% of the funds are directed towards learning, maybe an outdated district schoolhouse is overly large and requires a larger budget for maintenance. It could be entirely possible that schools with lower budgets, less overhead costs, are investing more of their budget in to the education of students than schools with a higher budget. 

   This all supports the theory as to why smaller schools see more academic success. A smaller school means hiring less teachers/overall staff, a smaller building to maintain, and a streamlined, focused curriculum. Successful schools being both tightly budgeted and small is not a coincidence.
